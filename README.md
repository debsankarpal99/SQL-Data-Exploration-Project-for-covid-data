# SQL Data Exploration Project for COVID-19 Data

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a SQL data exploration project focused on COVID-19 data. The project is built around a database named "PortfolioProjectAlexDA" that comprises two tables: 'CovidDeaths' and 'CovidVaccinations'. These tables contain data from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021. The primary aim of this project is to analyze and gain insights from this COVID-19 dataset using SQL queries.

## Database Details
- **Database Name:** PortfolioProjectAlexDA
- **Tables:**
  - 'CovidDeaths': Contains information about COVID-19 deaths, including dates and countries.
  - 'CovidVaccinations': Contains information about COVID-19 vaccinations, including dates and countries.

## Queries
The project involves seven SQL queries, each designed to answer specific questions and provide valuable insights from the COVID-19 data. Here is an overview of each query:

### Query 1: Finding Percentage of Deaths Over Cases Registered Day-wise in India
This query calculates the percentage of deaths compared to the number of cases registered in India on a day-by-day basis.

### Query 2: Finding Percentage of Cases Registered Over Total Population Day-wise in India
This query calculates the percentage of COVID-19 cases registered in India compared to the country's total population on a daily basis.

### Query 3: Looking at Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population
This query identifies countries with the highest infection rates, taking into account their respective populations.

### Query 4: Finding Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population
This query identifies countries with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths per capita.

### Query 5: Looking at Average Deaths per Country in a Continent
This query calculates the average number of COVID-19 deaths per country within each continent.

### Query 6: Daily New COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Worldwide
This query provides insights into the daily counts of new COVID-19 cases and deaths on a global scale.

### Query 7: Looking at Vaccinations vs. Population (Using Common Table Expressions - CTE)
This query utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to explore the relationship between COVID-19 vaccinations and the population of different countries.

## How to run the queries
To run these queries and explore the project's findings, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the 'PortfolioProjectAlexDA' database into your preferred SQL database management system.
3. Run the SQL queries from the 'queries' folder in your SQL environment.
4. Analyze the results to gain insights into the COVID-19 data.

Feel free to explore the project and modify the queries to suit your analysis needs.
